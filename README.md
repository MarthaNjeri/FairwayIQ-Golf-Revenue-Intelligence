# 🏌️ FairwayIQ: Golf Club Management & Revenue Intelligence (AI + BI Project)

FairwayIQ is an end-to-end data science and business intelligence project designed to help golf clubs improve **member retention, revenue growth, and operational decision-making** using analytics and machine learning.

This project consolidates membership engagement, spending behavior, and churn risk signals into an executive-ready intelligence platform.

## 📌 Business Problem

Golf clubs generate valuable data across:

- Membership subscriptions  
- Tee-time activity  
- Coaching participation  
- Tournament engagement  
- Pro shop and food & beverage spending  

However, most clubs lack an integrated analytics system to answer key questions such as:

- Which members generate the highest lifetime value?
- What engagement behaviors predict churn risk?
- How does playing frequency impact revenue?
- How can management optimize retention and club profitability?

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a **Revenue & Membership Intelligence Platform** that enables club leadership to:

✅ Understand revenue drivers  
✅ Segment members by value and engagement  
✅ Detect early churn risk  
✅ Support strategic retention initiatives  
✅ Leverage AI for predictive decision-making

## 🧾 Dataset Overview (Synthetic + Realistic)

Due to privacy constraints in private golf clubs, this project uses **synthetic data generated based on real-world golf club operations**, including realistic engagement and revenue patterns.

### Tables Generated

| `members.csv` | Member demographics and membership tier |
